    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to understand whether music listening habits have changed in the last 6 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons that lead us to believe music listening habits have changed:\n",
    "- the global COVID pandemic (2020-2021) is likely to have led to changes in how people listen to music and what music they listen to;\n",
    "- several articles mention the effects that the rise of social network TikTok (from 2018 on) is having on the music industry (see, for instance, https://theconversation.com/love-it-or-hate-it-tiktok-is-changing-the-music-industry-171482)\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus hypothesise that **listening habits are likely to have changed**, and asked the following questions to investigate that question:\n",
    "1. Have the music genres people listen to changed?\n",
    "2. Have the artists people listen to changed?\n",
    "3. Is the duration of the most popular songs decreasing?\n",
    "4. How have other track features changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data collection\n",
    "Every year, Spotify releases a playlist with the top 100 hit songs for that year. In order to answer the questions above, we selected 6 playlists, one for each of the last 6 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose playlists from 2017 to 2022 in order to capture both, any changes preceding the rise of TikTok and the COVID pandemic, as well as any long lasting changes in music listening habits post-COVID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the playlists were selected, we used the Spotipy API (https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/) to request information about each track on the playlist. Note that in order to get the requests, we first needed to set up our credentials, in the Spotify's Web API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). \n",
    "\n",
    "The information obtained from Spotipy was then combined into a single dataframe, with an added column to specify playlist year, resulting in a final dataframe with 600 rows (100 songs for each of the 6 years) by 24 columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe was carefully inspected for any missing data or duplicates, before being saved as a csv file. Duplicated songs that were on playlists for different years were kept, as the same song might be in the top for more than one year and that is important information. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information on the project and on the final results can be found in the project git hub repository (https://github.com/catisf/Project-1-Group-2) and in the data analyses jupyter notebook (https://github.com/catisf/Project-1-Group-2/blob/main/jupyter_notebooks/spotipy_data_analyses.ipynb)\n",
